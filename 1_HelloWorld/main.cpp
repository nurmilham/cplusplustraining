/*
“Hello World” program is the first step to learning any programming language.
1] #include: In C++, (#) signs are handled by a preprocessor which is a program invoked by the compiler. The #include advised the compiler to include a file and #include<iostream>, tells the compiler to include the standard <iostream> library which contains declarations of input/output library functions.
2] using namespace std: The using namespace statement just means that in the scope it is present, make all the things under the std namespace available without having to prefix std:: before each of them.
3] int main(): This line is utilized to declare a function named "main" which returns data of integer. 
4] return 0: This statement is used to return a value from a function and indicates the finishing of a function.
